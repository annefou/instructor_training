# CodeRefinery Sustainability plan

In October 2018 CodeRefinery entered the second phase of the project, with funding from [NeIC](https://neic.no)
until autumn 2021. A key objective for CodeRefinery 2.0 is to **render the project largely self-sustained after 
October 2021**.

## Vision

- After phase 2, travel and accommodation for workshops will be financed by the hosting
  institution, similarly to the Carpentries model. 
- The lesson material will be maintained by the community and volunteers.
- Employers will be encouraged to allow instructors across Nordics to participate in-kind in 1-2 workshops/year. 
- A completely self-financed organization may not be realistic, but we aim to arrive at
  a project which can continue using 0.5 - 1 FTE/year for coordination.

Reaching this goal will depend on developing institutional recognition for the project.  
But how do we get there?

## Benefits 

Universities, e-Science initiatives and other organizations need to be convinced to
support or otherwise endorse CodeRefinery.  

The pitch can be quite simple - continuity of the CodeRefinery project will lead to:
- More competent scientists and researchers
  - Software development is a core part of research for many scientists and researchers in the Nordics 
  - CodeRefinery contributes to an increased competence in software development tools and techniques among scientists and researchers
  - Preparation and delivery of workshops is also a great learning opportunity for the instructors
- Better science
  - Reproducibility of research code
  - Reusable and extensible code
  - Collaborative learning and knowledge transfer

## Building a community

Building a community will be another essential requirement to reach sustainability.

Several avenues should be pursued:

- Train-the-trainer program
  - Promote, train, and certify future trainers at annual train-the-trainer workshops
- Symbiosis with The Carpentries and PRACE advanced training centers
  - CodeRefinery can be positioned as the second step after attending a Carpentry workshop
  - Coordinating with PRACE advanced training centers, embed CodeRefinery workshops within PRACE?
- Symbiosis with local units
  - Partner with universities to bring workshops to their community as a default service
  - Aalto Science IT to serve as perfect model
- [Research software engineer (RSE) community in the Nordics](http://nordic-rse.org/)
  - CodeRefinery can serve as a hub 
  - Bi-annual conferences, inspired by [UK-RSE](https://rse.ac.uk/conf2019/)

## What can you do?

- First and foremost: teach workshops!
- Spread the word. Tell friends and colleagues about upcoming workshops		
  and encourage them to become instructors
- Talk to your higher-ups. Is your employer willing to contribute in-kind?
